Sure! Here's the translation:

# AdrenalinAntivirus

This is an antivirus written 100% in Python, excluding the libraries used. It serves a purpose since it has a daily hash update function implemented. **REMEMBER** that when you run it for the first time, the hashes will start from **ZERO**, so don't assume it is 100% secure right away. This will be addressed later. I am using the **Malware-Basar** API to implement the hash update function (You must have the txt file present in the repository in the directory of the .py file).

Regarding the program's speed, I am not sure what to do.

# Updates:

. Added the system tray icon functionality that allows restoring or exiting the application. (Remember, you must have the antivirus icon in the directory of the .py or .exe file. It will be in the repository.)

. Implemented the behavior to hide the window when closing, keeping the application running.

. Added the hourly_check function to update the hashes every hour.

# Next Updates:

. Addition of web protection.
